**Notes**
  - Reports should be unique to the crop and "grow style" of the associated plant
  - When to use an Enumerable and when to use Polymorphic Associations
  - Want to focus on writing tests
  - Use Figma to plan out the design?
  - Will need helpers(?) for calculating some data and for creating schedules
